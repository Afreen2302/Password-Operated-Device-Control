## PASSWORD OPERATED DEVICE CONTROL
An electronic lock, also known as a digital lock, integrates an electronic control assembly, enabling sophisticated access control. Users interact with the lock through a keypad, entering a password to gain entry. Upon correct input, an LED indicator illuminates in vibrant green, while an incorrect entry prompts a bright red warning, with no illumination on other occasions. Additionally, an accompanying buzzer emits a confirming sound upon incorrect entry. For added security, users have the option to customize their passwords.
Key components of this system include a keypad, an LCD display, and a controller, specifically the AT89S51, belonging to the esteemed 8051 series of microcontrollers. Employing a 4x3 matrix keypad and a 16x2 LCD, the system utilizes widely recognized input and output devices, respectively. Users are required to set a four-digit password, which is securely stored within the system.
During the unlocking process, the entered password is compared against the stored one. Upon a successful match, the lock disengages, accompanied by a green LED blink, and an LCD message. Additionally, an output pin is activated for further functionalities.
The system initiates by prompting the user with the message "Enter Password" on the LCD screen. Subsequently, the keypad is scanned for input, with corresponding digits masked on the display. After all, four digits are entered, they undergo comparison with the preset password. A match triggers the LCD to display "Lock Open" and activates the lock output pin. Conversely, an incorrect entry prompts the display of "Wrong Password" on the LCD. Following three consecutive failed attempts, the system automatically locks, necessitating a reset.
